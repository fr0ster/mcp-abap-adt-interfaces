// Publishes exactly the packages whose version is not on the registry yet.
//
// Publishing every workspace by hand republishes what has not changed, and npm
// answers each of those with "You cannot publish over the previously published
// versions". Those lines are not harmless: four of them scrolling past teach the
// eye to skip the fifth, which is a real failure. So nothing already published is
// ever attempted, and a publish that errors stops the run.
//
// **A slow registry read does not stop it.** This waited for each version to be
// SERVED before publishing the next package, on the reasoning that nothing
// should go out depending on a version that might not exist. Three releases in
// two days ended the same way: the first package published, the read-through
// took longer than the wait, the run exited, and the second package was never
// attempted. A half-published release, caused entirely by the safeguard.
//
// The wait bought nothing the next publish needs. `npm run check` runs ONCE,
// before any of this, over tarballs built here; it never reads the registry.
// And `npm publish` uploads a tarball, it does not resolve the ranges in the
// manifest it uploads, so publishing B never asks whether A is being served.
// What reads those ranges is a consumer installing afterwards, and by then the
// question is whether A is on the registry at all -- which the verification at
// the end answers, for every package at once.
//
// So: publish everything, then verify everything. A version the registry has
// not served by the end is reported by name and exits 2, distinct from a
// publish that failed. Nothing is lost either way, because re-running skips
// whatever is already there.
//
// It also runs `npm run check` ONCE. Publishing five workspaces ran every
// package's prepublishOnly, which is the same full check five times over; the
// publishes here pass --ignore-scripts because the check has already run.
//
// What it guarantees: the tarball holds the tree the release tag names. A tag
// that is merely an ancestor of HEAD does not give that — a commit after the tag
// can change a package without bumping its version, and the tarball then carries
// content the tagged version never had. So the tree must equal the tag's tree.
